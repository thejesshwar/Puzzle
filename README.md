In this project, I have implemented the RRT-
Connect algorithm for path planning in a given maze. The

problem involved restoring a distorted image using bitwise
operations, performing template matching to extract relevant
portions, and finally executing RRT-Connect to find a path
between two specified points in the maze. The implementation
was done using Python and OpenCV, and all steps were
performed without inbuilt template matching or path-planning
functions. The approach ensures efficient path discovery while
handling real-world constraints.
